# SSR Fix Applied âœ…

## Problem
```
ReferenceError: indexedDB is not defined
```
This happened because Next.js tried to access IndexedDB during server-side rendering (SSR), but IndexedDB only exists in browsers.

## Solution Applied

Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` guards to all browser API calls:

1. **Constructor** - Only initializes on client
2. **init()** - Checks for window and indexedDB
3. **saveConversation()** - Returns empty string during SSR
4. **getConversations()** - Returns empty array during SSR  
5. **getAnonymousId()** - Returns placeholder during SSR
6. **generateDeviceFingerprint()** - Returns placeholder during SSR

## What This Means
- Server renders the page without errors
- Browser takes over and initializes IndexedDB
- All storage features work normally on client side
- No functionality lost, just safer initialization

The page should now load without the IndexedDB error!
